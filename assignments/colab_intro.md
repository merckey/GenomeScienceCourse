# Colab intro from Google research

[Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), or 'Colab' for short, is a 
Google research project created to help disseminate  education and research in 
data science. It's a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use 
and runs entirely in the cloud. It's highly integrated with Google Drive, 
making them easy to set up, access, and share. If you are unfamiliar with Google 
Colab or Jupyter notebooks, you can explore from the 
[Colab welcome site](https://colab.research.google.com).

## Colab for R

In principle, colab is very similar to local 
[jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). 
By default, it runs a Python environment, but with the support from 
[IRKernel](https://irkernel.github.io/), it also support R environment, for 
example the 
[demo.ipynb](https://colab.fan/IRkernel/IRkernel/example-notebooks/Demo.ipynb)

Open the following link in your browser, you will create a new notebook with R
